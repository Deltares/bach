<p>Due to the increase of population and climate change Crystal city has implemented a reservoir upstream to store water for domestic use (See <a href="#fig-reservoir" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>). The reservoir is to help ensure a reliable supply during dry periods. In this module, the user will update the model to incorporate the reservoirâ€™s impact on the whole Crystal basin.</p>
